The method would run in the AutoShowroom as it feels logically right since an AutoShowroom
should be the one having access to display all buyers


public void allBuyers()


We could have the method go through the existing functions and print all of the
possible buyers.

We can go through the car Arraylist,loop through it and the bids Array.From there
the method will put each unique buyer in a list to print for later.As it goes
through each bid and buyer,it will also check it's list to prevent duplicates.

After it loops through the car Arraylist,it will then loop through it's made
list and print each buyer out in a fixed string format to display the buyers

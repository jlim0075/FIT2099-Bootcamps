int
Advantages
- Accept only integers and would prevent errors/situations where people accidentally
key in an alphabet


Disadvantages
- It could be confusing or disorientating at times as all buyerids have integers only
that it'd be easy to lose track of the exact buyerid.



string
Advantages
- Depending on the decision,we could have alphabets with our ids (JL9493) which will
make each buyerID unique and easy to distinguish

Disadvantages
- Since we're using numbers for IDs,it would mess up the bids if someone were to accidentally
put an alphabet along with the numbers as input


Overall,i would choose numeric integer as we only want numbers and will put an error if
non numbers are entered.




We use givenName and familyName instead of firstName and lastName in order to cater
to people.Some people might have family names as their first given as the last.So it
would be best to be specific as possible in what to ask for.
